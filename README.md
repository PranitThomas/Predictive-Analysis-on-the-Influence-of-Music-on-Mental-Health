In today's fast-paced world, mental health concerns are on the rise, with an estimated 1 in 8 people worldwide living with a mental disorder. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), mental health conditions are projected to account for 20% of the global disease burden by 2030, with depression and anxiety among the leading causes of disability. Music, as a universal language, has long been associated with emotional and psychological regulation, offering both therapeutic and expressive benefits. Research has shown that music can influence mood, reduce stress, and provide comfort during challenging times. With this understanding, our project seeks to develop a platform that assesses the relationship between music preferences and mental health indicators. By creating a model that predicts key psychological parameters—'Unhealthy', 'Healthy', 'K-10', 'Openness', 'Conscientiousness', 'Extraversion', 'Agreeableness', and 'Neuroticism'—we aim to provide valuable insights into how music affects well-being and personality traits.

Our project is built on an extensive dataset that captures a wide range of variables related to demographics, music habits, and mental health. The dataset consists of over 60 columns, including inputs such as 'Gender', 'Age', 'Nationality', 'Your interest in music?', and 'What kind of music do you like to listen to when you feel low?'. These inputs are essential in understanding the user’s interaction with music and its potential impact on their mental state. For instance, questions related to emotional responses to music—such as 'I hide in my music because nobody understands me, and it blocks people out' and 'Music helps me relax'—offer insight into how music is used as a coping mechanism. Additionally, the dataset includes mental health-related questions based on the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K-10), a well-established tool for measuring anxiety and depression symptoms, which forms the foundation for predicting the 'K-10' score.

The model we are developing leverages machine learning techniques to analyze user inputs and predict outcomes for the aforementioned psychological parameters. 'Openness', 'Conscientiousness', 'Extraversion', 'Agreeableness', and 'Neuroticism' are key personality traits that are critical in understanding an individual's behavior, relationships, and emotional resilience. For instance, high levels of 'Extraversion' might indicate a tendency to engage in social activities, while 'Neuroticism' often correlates with emotional instability and higher stress levels. By offering personalized predictions based on these traits, the system provides users with a deeper understanding of their psychological landscape. It not only shows how their music habits relate to mental health but also provides actionable insights into areas that may require attention. For example, users who score higher on 'Neuroticism' and 'Unhealthy' might be encouraged to adopt healthier music practices to improve their mental well-being. Similarly, individuals with lower 'Conscientiousness' scores may discover how music influences their ability to focus and organize.

The potential applications of this project extend beyond individual users to mental health professionals and researchers. As mental health awareness continues to grow, tools like ours could offer a novel approach to understanding emotional well-being through the lens of music therapy. Studies have already shown that music therapy can be an effective treatment for anxiety, depression, and other mental health conditions. By combining this with a predictive model that analyzes a user's personality and mental health status, we can provide personalized music-based interventions that enhance mental well-being. For example, an individual experiencing high levels of stress or anxiety could receive recommendations on specific types of music that may help alleviate their symptoms. Furthermore, the platform could be integrated into wellness apps, allowing users to track their mental health progress over time and adjust their music habits accordingly.

In conclusion, this project represents a significant step towards understanding the intricate connection between music and mental health. By predicting parameters such as 'Unhealthy', 'Healthy', 'K-10', 'Openness', 'Conscientiousness', 'Extraversion', 'Agreeableness', and 'Neuroticism', we aim to offer users valuable insights into how their music choices shape their emotional and psychological states. As mental health continues to be a critical issue globally, our platform has the potential to become a valuable tool for both individuals and professionals looking for personalized ways to improve well-being. Through the power of machine learning and the universal influence of music, this project aspires to contribute to a deeper understanding of mental health, providing a scalable and innovative solution for those seeking to enhance their mental and emotional well-being.
